## "Tarifa": Between Two Seas

### Problem

> There are three Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file: an HAProxy accepting connetions on port :5000 of the host, and two nginx containers, not exposed to the host. The person who tried to set this up wanted to have HAProxy in front of the (backend or upstream) nginx containers load-balancing them but something is not working.
