## "Tokamachi": Troubleshooting a Named Pipe

### Problem

https://sadservers.com/scenario/tokamachi

### Solution

TDLR: use `flock` and `mkfifo`.

1. `mkfifo namedpipe`.
2. `/bin/bash -c 'while true; do klock -x /home/admin/namedpipe -c \"echo "this is a test message being sent to the pipe" > /home/admin/namedpipe\"; done' &`

Named pipes simplify communication between processes running on the same system. For example:

- A process writes to the pipe (echo > namedpipe).
- Another process reads from the pipe (cat < namedpipe).

When multiple producers (writers) and consumers (readers) use the same named pipe, flock can help regulate access to prevent deadlocks or race conditions.
